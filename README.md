## What should you know?

I have separeted the backend and frontend. You need to run the backend and frontend on the different CLI.
There is some dependencies that i have used in. So there are some "API KEYS or IDs" and "STRINGS" you need to change it with your own in the environment file.

> **Note:** Before run the scripts you need to change the ".env.local" to the ".env".
